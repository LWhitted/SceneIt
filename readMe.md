The app is called Scene It (lol, get it? Like a movie “scene”? #sorrynotsorry). It’s a simple tool for searching for movies, flagging ones you want to watch, and later giving them a thumbs up or thumbs down after you watch them. The finished product will use AJAX to make requests to an external API called OMDB.
